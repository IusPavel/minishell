# minishell
As beautiful as a shell

FINALLY FINISHED!
Minishell like the bash. As so cool as so hard.
3 months. 3... months.
Pipes, redirects, heredoc, quotes, signals, environment, some builtins. Everything is work.
But just one big fault was made is a serial execution instead parallel. My mistake. Next time I will do better.
And now let's go to the next level!
